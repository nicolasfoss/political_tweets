This tweet containing a hypothesis about Donald Trump's Twitter account needs to be investigated with data:

Every non-hyperbolic tweet is from iPhone (his staff). Every hyperbolic tweet is from Android (from him).

Others have explored Trump’s timeline and noticed this tends to hold up. And Trump himself did indeed tweet from a Samsung Galaxy until March 2017. But how could it be examined quantitatively? In this project, I applied text mining and sentiment analysis to determine whether or not Trump does indeed write the angrier, Android tweets

The dataset used in this project is from The Trump Twitter Archive by Brendan Brown, which contains all 35,000+ tweets from the @realDonaldTrump Twitter account from 2009 (the year Trump sent his first tweet) through 2018.
